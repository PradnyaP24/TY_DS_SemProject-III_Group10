ðŸ“… Week 1: 07/08/2025 â€“ 11/08/2025
Work Done:
Understood the fundamentals of object detection and its applications in automation and spatial analysis.
Researched popular object detection algorithms (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD) and their comparative strengths.
Defined the project objectives and scope with a focus on integrating object detection into space synthesis for real-world use.
Explored dataset sources (COCO, Pascal VOC, custom datasets) for object detection tasks.
Challenges Faced:
Selecting the most suitable dataset for automation-related objects.
Understanding the integration between object detection outputs and spatial synthesis.
Next Steps:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on chosen datasets.
Begin preprocessing images and annotations.
ðŸ“… Week 2: 10/08/2025 â€“ 22/09/2025
Work Done:
Conducted EDA on selected datasets to understand object distribution.
Preprocessed data: annotation verification, resizing images, normalization.
Implemented baseline object detection models (YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN) for preliminary testing.
Generated visualizations of detected objects for early validation.
Challenges Faced:
Managing class imbalance for underrepresented objects.
Fine-tuning detection thresholds to minimize false positives/negatives.
Next Steps:
Optimize models with hyperparameter tuning.
Start designing the pipeline for space synthesis integration.
ðŸ“… Week 3: 24/0/92025 â€“ 05/09/2025
Work Done:
Fine-tuned the chosen object detection model to improve accuracy and robustness.
Validated results using test datasets and analyzed precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision).
Designed initial framework for space synthesis, mapping detected objects into spatial layouts.
Developed visual reports showing object counts, categories, and spatial positioning.
Challenges Faced:
Deciding the best representation method for spatial synthesis.
Handling overlapping objects and optimizing layout placement logic.
Next Steps:
Work on documentation and prepare mid-project report.
Expand space synthesis model to handle larger and more complex object sets.
